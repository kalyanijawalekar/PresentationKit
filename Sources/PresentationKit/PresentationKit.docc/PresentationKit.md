# ``PresentationKit``

A SwiftUI library that makes it easy to present alerts and modal content.

## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

PresentationKit is a SwiftUI library that makes it easy to present alerts, sheets, and full screen covers for any identifiable model, by using observable ``AlertContext``, ``FullScreenCoverContext``, and ``SheetContext`` classes.

PresentationKit lets you register a presentation strategy for any identifiable model, and will create and inject unique context values into the environment for each modal layer. This lets you use the current contexts to present new content from any view.
